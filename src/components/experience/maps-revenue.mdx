Manufacturers do not have easy access to the location details of the retailers who carry their product. Consider Samsung launching their new phone - they want to run location-based ads to navigate consumers to their nearest Best Buy to purchase their product. 
I worked on a cross-organization project at Google to launch a new Local Ads product - affiliate location extensions. We used machines & humans to curate highly precise location data for thousands of chains across the globe. This data was then used by both manufacturers as well as the chains themselves to run location-based ads.

I was the lead PM on the Google Maps' side of the project. I worked with designers & engineers to define a tool that we could use to make chain data curation more efficient. I then worked with program managers to incorporate this tool into our workflows and launch thousands of curated chains for ad usage. Thereafter, I put together a data maintenance strategy that saves Google millions of dollars per year with its approach. 
The Local Ads' products using chain data drive billions of $s in revenue each year.
