In 2018 I joined the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh as lead developer for the
Innovation Studio. Having secured a USD 150,000
[grant from the Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/museums-technology-new-avenues-for-wonder/),
our goal was to create a chatbot that museum guests could engage with inside and
outside the museum. We partnered with Advancement and Community Engagement (ACE)
team to digitize their existing Summer Adventure program and open it up for all
our visitors. You can read more about CarnegieBot in this
