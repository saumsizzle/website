# **Re-engaging Maps users after COVID**

## Causing a 1.15% lift in DAUs with a personalized notification

Unsurprisingly, Google Maps experienced a significant amount of churn during COVID. 
With nowhere to go, users were no longer using the Maps product. As a result, as places began to open up, users remained unaware.
Many users save places on the Map that they love ('Favorites') or would like to visit ('Want to go' list). 

I conceived the idea to notify users when a place they saved reopens after being temporarily closed due to COVID mandates.
We launched this notification as a controlled experiment, and observed a 1.15% increase in daily engagement relative to the group of users who did not receive the notification.
