Kindle Unlimited is a subscription service to a virtual library of over 4 million digital books. 
When I worked at Amazon as a software engineering intern during a co-op in Fall 2014, Kindle Unlimited was newly launched.
I redesigned & redeveloped the landing page for KU and ran an A/B test to discover that the new landing page performed significantly better than the original. Sign-ups increased by over 30% resulting in increased revenue for Amazon. 
I also spearheaded the team's adoption of a unified design language (at this time, Amazon used several different orange-yellows for its primary button). This improved the speed & quality of front-end engineering on the team.
