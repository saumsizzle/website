Built two major features.
### Roster Import
While at Google Classroom, I launched a roster import feature that syncs Student Information Systems to Google Classroom. We partnered with <a href="https://clever.com/" target="_blank"><i>Clever</i></a> to develop this feature and I led the product partnership on Google's behalf. This feature alone saved teachers over 500,000 hours of valuable prep time and increased sales of Google for Education’s premium SKU. 
### Classroom Visits
Education leaders ranked the ability to see teachers’ classes as their #1 need from Classroom. We launched this as the pioneering feature for our new education leader hub. I identified and prioritized MVP features for the education leader hub, worked with eng to determine a plan to parallelize more than previously believed possible, and effectively marshaled additional resources (+12 engineers) for accelerating the launch of the Classroom Visit capability.
When we launched Class Visits, it eliminated the need for ineffective workarounds to access Classrooms and helped retain large districts on our platform.
