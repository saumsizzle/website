A significant amount of the Indian population can speak and understand English but not read or write in the language. 
Maps' search queries were failing as users searched for English words in their local language script. 

To increase the usability of Google Maps in India, I worked with a research scientist to build a transliteration model from English to the top 10 Indian languages.
After rigorous quality testing, we added millions of transliterated POI names to the Maps database, thereby bringing up
the coverage of local language names in India from 5% to over 95%.
