ClassDojo, being in over 90% of schools in the United States, was looking to expand internationally. 
As I was moving back to India after 12 years in the US, I was looking for a transitional role at an American
ed tech company I could work for from India. I joined ClassDojo on a short-term contract to define their growth strategy in India.
I conducted user research, identified strategic partners, and wrote our playbook for growth in India. 
The framework I defined for the growth playbook was then adapted for every other market that ClassDojo was trying to expand in.

I began to execute on the strategy and pilot a variety of techniques to foster growth. This resulted in a 50% bump in users in our target segment.
